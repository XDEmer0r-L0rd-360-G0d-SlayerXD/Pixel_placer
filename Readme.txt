Places pixels in the background. Still very WIP even though it works.

ideas that may still need to implemented:
make captcha more noticeable such as sound, bring site to front.
run from cmd command
get user data from nearby text file
make code more user friendly
convert image file to instructions
checking for already placed pixel
